# ExESS -- CHANGELOG

## v0.1.9 (2024/??/??) - current changes

- added `pclamp` utility function
  + periodic clamp function that limits the input to a given range, where the overflow is
    wrapped around to the other side of the range
  + important for periodic values like longitude/azimuth angles
- adjusted `coord2idx` functions for grids
  + using the new `pclamp` function to correctly handle overvflowing coordinates
  + added output type `Int64` to the function signature
  
 
## v0.1.8b (2024/06/26)

- edited and added more constants to `moon/constants.jl`
- added more icons/logos for subsystems, to be used in the GitHub Wiki
  - `res/exess-coords-logo` for custom coordinates
- housekeeping of scripts and tests

## v0.1.8 (2024/06/07)

- added `physical_chemistry.jl` script to `/drivers`
  - includes `arrhenius` and `diffusion_time` functions
- fixed: `mode` included in exported methods
- added `CERES_DAY` and `MERCURY_DAY` constants
- added more and edited existing tests
- _(internal)_ added utility function to handle `erfinv` calls with `Float16` types
- fixed depreciations inside of the `trajectory` calculation
- several housekeeping changes and bugfixes

## v0.1.7 (2024/04/16)

- updated `base\constants.jl` to include the latest values for the physical constants
  CODATA 2018 database
- added docstrings to `base\constants.jl` with the appropriate mention of the **sources**
- added kilo joule per mole to electronvolt conversion to `base\utils.jl`
  + `kJpmol2eV` and `eV2kJpmol` functions


## v0.1.6 (2024/04/04)

- fixed Chamberlain projection (wrong order of radius arguments)
- updated Chamberlain projection function call (breaking)
  + the call does no longer include the known density `n1`
  + central body mass `M` moven from `kwargs` to `args`
  + type stability
  + behaviour tests and comparison to literature


## v0.1.5 (2024/03/25)

- added type stability tests for trajectory calculations
- fixed trajectory benchmarking
- added behaviour tests for trajectories
- edit Chamberlain projection to include selectable partitions
- general housekeeping

## v0.1.3 (2024/02/28)

- added support for vectorized `Base.rand` calls of custom distributions
- edited multivariate maxwellians to be more efficient (fewer allocations) when using
  type casts in vectorized calls
- minor formatting updates
