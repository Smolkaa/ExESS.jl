# ExESS -- CHANGELOG

## v0.1.12 (2025/04/11)

- FEATURE/HOUSEKEEPING: Changed `lunar_surface_temperatue_BUTLER1997` to 
  `lunar_surface_temperature_CRIDER2002` and added the optional for a single input of a
  solar zenith angle. Adjusted the `solar_angle` function as well as tests accordingly.
- HOUSEKEEPING: Changed the internal `_get` function to the `Base` extension of the Tuple
  function: `Base.Tuple`, as well as all occurences of `_get` in the code base. Note that
  the field specific getter functions are still available and can be used as before.
- FEATURE: added `PSDSpeedDistribution` to model particle speed distributions following
  photon-stimulated-desorption (PSD), based on the works of Gamborino et al. (2018).
- HOUSEKEEPING: renamed `solar_angle` to `solar_incidence_angle` to clarify the function's
  purpose and usage 
- FEATURE: added `local_solar_incidence_angle` as an extension to the `solar_incidence_angle`
  function, which now also accepts a local slopes and azimuths as input
  - adjusted function to work with common coordinate system (azimuth starts at zero
    towards east and is defined mathematically positive)
- HOUSEKEEPING (breaking): Changed the `trajectory` call signature to have the acceleration
  function in the `kwargs...` instead. Adjusted the tests accordingly.
- HOUSEKEEPING: Removed `LocalSphericalVelocity` vector type, as it is unused throughout
  the entire project. The removal improves code-readability, and general cleanliness.


## v0.1.11 (2024/10/08)

- BUGFIX: `landing_position` and `time_of_flight` functions in `trajectory.jl` now handle
  special velocity cases (vertical, horizontal, zero, and negative) correctly and not return
  `NaN` values anymore
- HOUSEKEEPING: lunar surface temperature functions
  - unified format, docstrings, and typesetting
  - fixed `lunar_surface_temperatures_DIVINER_avg` to correctly access the data
- HOUSEKEEPING & BUGFIX: renamed `coordinates` to `vectors` in tests and fixed the cartesian
  rotation functions, which previously rotated in the wrong direction
    - added tests for the cartesian rotation functions
- FEATURE: added `lonrange` and `latrange` keywords to `Spherical3DGrid`s to have partial
  partial three-dimensional grids
    - added tests for three-dimensional spherical grids
    - housekeeping for all grids: docstrings, renamings, etc.


## v0.1.10 (2024/08/26)

- BUGFIX of `coord2idx` for `Spherical2DGrid_EqSim` and `Spherical2DGrid_Reduced_Eqsim`, 
  which now correctly mirrors the latitude values onto the northern hemisphere and does not
  clip it to the equator anymore
- BUGFIX of `coord2idx` to also correctly handle boundary cases close to `pi` and `-pi`
- renamed `coordinates/` to `vectors/` to clarify the notation
  - also renamed `AbstractCoordinate` to `AbstractEVector`, which is short for "abtract
    ExESS vector" and should not be confused with the `AbstractVector` type
- removed the `GlobalSphericalVelocity` type as it was never used and wrongly defined, based
  on the new vector/coordinate definitions and notations
- added new velocity type `LocalSphericalVelocity`
  - edited `maxwellian`s to use the new velocity type in sampler function
- removed the local cartesian 3d grid type (reverted into the private repo)
- added `Statistics.mean` extension for Maxwellian elevation distributions
- changed `MBVelocityDistribution` to be strictly positive in upwards (z) direction
- added partial grid functionality to `Spherical2DGrid` types through additional
  keywords `longrange` and `latrange`
- renamed `theta` and `phi` to `lon` and `lat` in grids for consistency and differentiation
  from spherical vectors

## v0.1.9 (2024/07/05)

- added `pclamp` utility function
  + periodic clamp function that limits the input to a given range, where the overflow is
    wrapped around to the other side of the range
  + important for periodic values like longitude/azimuth angles
- adjusted `coord2idx` functions for grids
  + using the new `pclamp` function to correctly handle overvflowing coordinates
  + added output type `Int64` to the function signature
- added `mapgrid` function that maps values defined on one grid to another
- updated grid tests (among others: tested `mapgrid` function)
- added more icons/logos for subsystems, to be used in the GitHub Wiki
  - `res/exess-constants-icon` for custom defined constants
  - `res/exess-drivers-icon` for drivers of exospheres
  - `res/exess-grids-icon` for custom grids
  
 
## v0.1.8b (2024/06/26)

- added more icons/logos for subsystems, to be used in the GitHub Wiki
  - `res/exess-coords-icon` for custom coordinates
- housekeeping of scripts and tests

## v0.1.8 (2024/06/07)

  - includes `arrhenius` and `diffusion_time` functions
- fixed: `mode` included in exported methods
- added `CERES_DAY` and `MERCURY_DAY` constants

  + `kJpmol2eV` and `eV2kJpmol` functions


## v0.1.6 (2024/04/04)

- fixed Chamberlain projection (wrong order of radius arguments)
- updated Chamberlain projection function call (breaking)
  + the call does no longer include the known density `n1`

  + type stability
  + behaviour tests and comparison to literature


## v0.1.5 (2024/03/25)

  type casts in vectorized calls
- minor formatting updates
